- [ ] "-s" takes optional parameter. If none is given, sabe back using same source/password. If "-s" is missing completely, pipe. Piping can be binary, json, or pretty json
  - [ ] Handle better the `save` in the main::match (I don't like it that each branch returns a save.. Only `read` doesnt save)
- [ ] Support empty paths to refer to the whole store
- [ ] Support `-f` to do an unchecked insert
- [ ] Test with real fs
  - [ ] From/to file
  - [ ] From/to dir
- [ ] Remove std::io::stdout() from main
- [ ] Break down test into what it is actually asserting
- [ ] Implement "S3"
- [ ] Create, delete, update make no sense without output
- [ ] Read, print make no sense with "--save"
- [ ] Consider implement piping
- [ ] Rucline frontend
- [ ] QT frontend (check nheko as GUI for JS-style UI)
- [ ] Web frontend
- [ ] Slim down store
  - [ ] Move `delete_path` recursive logic into nested_map
  - [ ] Move `is_new_entry` recursive logic into nested_map
  - [ ] (?) Path iterator for nested map
- [ ] Redesign
  - [ ] Instead of nested have tags
  - [ ] Allow multiple fields of basic types (only name and tags are fixed)
  - [ ] Have a serach command (fuzzy) that searches all fields
  - [ ] Allow printing to be usable in shell (maybe by specifying the field, the json shows pure string?)
